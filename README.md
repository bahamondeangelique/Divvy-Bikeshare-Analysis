# 🚲 Divvy Bike-Share Data Analysis — Capstone Project

Welcome to my bike-powered data adventure!  
This repository contains my complete analysis of 12 months of Divvy bike-share data, following the full data analytics lifecycle: Ask → Prepare → Process → Analyze → Share → Act.

My mission:  
✨ Understand how *casual riders* and *annual members* use Divvy differently  
✨ Uncover ride patterns, trends, and behavior  
✨ Provide strong, data-backed recommendations to help convert casual riders into members  

All datasets are publicly available from Divvy’s official trip data repository:
